TRL's Managing Director, C.D Kamath was a very experienced and visionary leader, and he decided that we needed to go to work rather than getting such long training. The training was not typical learning in classes or human resource department rather it was field-based training. We learned by working.

For the last seven years, I've started spending around an hour daily on meditation and that has helped me immensely in maintaining work-life balance and calming down my restless mind. A lot of things in your career are not in your control and thus you have to engage in other activities to divert your mind when things don't go your way. I picked photography as a hobby, I spend time with my family and friends, I get involved in community-based organizations, and now I am slowly picking woodworking as a hobby.

You can considerably accelerate the learn-ing if you learn from other's mistakes. I would suggest students have mentors so that you can learn from other's mistakes.

My\n                        wife was of great help!\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    {/* </p> */}\n                    <h4>How did the initial industry exposure at TRL and further research experience inspire you to\n                        establish\n                        Y-Carbon? </h4>\n                    <p>Definitely, there is a big role of Tata Refractories Limited (TRL) in shaping my career. TRL used to\n                        hire\n                        students from engineering colleges and they used to call them graduate trainees. Before we joined,\n                        the\n                        graduate trainees got a year or a year and half of training and then you would be placed into a job.\n                        In our\n                        case, that's not what happened. TRL's Managing Director, C.D Kamath was a very experienced and\n                        visionary\n                        leader, and he decided that we needed to go to work rather than getting such long training. The\n                        training was\n                        not typical learning in classes or human resource department rather it was field-based training. We\n                        learned\n                        by working. When you start working and are accountable for your job, you start learning quickly. In\n                        the\n                        process, I was placed in the Dolomite Department as a Senior Officer and I was the second-in-charge\n                        there. I\n                        performed very well at Dolomite and liked my job. When you are in such an accountable position at an\n                        early\n                        age, it would likely have a positive impact on your career. My experience at TRL wasn't the only\n                        factor in\n                        starting Y-Carbon, because I wasn't aspiring to start a company at that time but it did help me in\n                        my\n                        career.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>From being the general secretary of Ceramic engineering de-partment to Co-founder, CTO/CEO & Board\n                        Member of\n                        Y Carbon and now a Senior Specialist, Technology & Acquisition at Sabic you have occupied numerous\n                        positions\n                        of responsibilities. How do you manage the pressure and despondency at the same time ? </h4>\n                    <p>We generally spend more time working than any other activity. Work can be quite stressful if you\n                        don't enjoy\n                        it. Stress would naturally come to someone who is expecting a lot from his/her life. I was not very\n                        good at\n                        handling stress although I was better than others. For the last seven years, I've started spending\n                        around an\n                        hour daily on meditation and that has helped me immensely in maintaining work-life balance and\n                        calming down\n                        my restless mind. A lot of things in your career are not in your control and thus you have to engage\n                        in\n                        other activities to divert your mind when things don't go your way. I picked photography as a hobby,\n                        I spend\n                        time with my family and friends, I get involved in community-based organizations, and now I am\n                        slowly\n                        picking woodworking as a hobby. And as time passes, when you get more mature you can handle things\n                        much more\n                        easily than when you were young. One has to understand that life is not only about work, and in\n                        order to\n                        live a complete life, he/she has to engage in non-work activities.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>A message to the students and readers.</h4>\n                    <p>In general, there are a few things that have helped me immensely in my career. One of them is I do\n                        seek\n                        advice from experienced professionals and mentors. A lot of people don't have mentors, instead, they\n                        believe\n                        in learning from their own mistakes which is great but it takes time. You can considerably\n                        accelerate the\n                        learn-ing if you learn from other's mistakes. I would suggest students have mentors so that you can\n                        learn\n                        from other's mistakes. I have been quite disappointed that the NIT Rourkela community (stu-dent,\n                        faculty,\n                        and alumni) don't make efficient use of its vast alumni base to seek guidance. Alumni can be great\n                        mentors\n                        and they can come for free.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Blog1\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
