The expectations from my parents and the people of the village forced me to take 10th grade seriously. I worked hard in 10th grade and transitioned myself from being a below-average performing student to achieving first-division. This transition gave me the confidence to prepare for engineering. I was admitted to Gangadhar Meher College, Sambalpur for my 10 +2 education. I was very much inclined to get into IITs; however, I was not able to qualify for their entrance examination.

The initial faculties, Prof. Santanu Bhattacharyya, Dr. Sukumar Adak, and Prof. Swadesh Pratihar worked hard to build the department.

I also had training at the TMDC (Tata Management Development Center), which had a strong influence on me about business. At Drexel University, while I was doing my doctoral research, I managed to gather a team to develop a business plan for Drexel's Entrepreneurship Center's business plan competition. I developed a relationship with one of the LeBow School of Business's faculty, Dr. Sam Kurokawa, who later became my mentor. I used to have several conversations with him regarding the business plan, my interest in business and it got a point that I started taking more MBA classes. I approached my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Yury Gogotsi, and enquired whether he would be okay if I pursue an MBA while doing my Ph.D., and he readily accepted it. I have always been a hardworking person and by the time I got interested in MBA I had already completed 70-80% of my Ph.D. work.

My father was a gynecologist and\n                        he used\n                        to practice in the village. In order for us to have a better education than what was available in\n                        the\n                        village, he placed us in The Kosala School which was located in Nua Khairpali, about halfway between\n                        Bargarh\n                        and Sambalpur. The Kosala School was one of the very few boarding schools in Odisha at that time. I\n                        got\n                        admitted to the 5th grade. I didn't take education seriously until 10th grade. The expectations from\n                        my\n                        parents and the people of the village forced me to take 10th grade seriously. I worked hard in 10th\n                        grade\n                        and transitioned myself from being a below-average performing student to achieving first-division.\n                        This\n                        transition gave me the confidence to prepare for engineering. I was admitted to Gangadhar Meher\n                        College,\n                        Sambalpur for my 10 +2 education. I was very much inclined to get into IITs; however, I was not able\n                        to\n                        qualify for their entrance examination. I did decent enough in Odisha JEE. I was influenced by an\n                        article in\n                        CSR (Competition Success Review) about ceramics and that very motivated me to opt for Ceramics\n                        Engineering\n                        at REC Rourkela.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>Any particular life-changing event that occurred during the course of B.Tech. or later which led you\n                        to\n                        pursue PhD?</h4>\n                    <p>There are a lot of events during engineering days that positively influenced my life. It is difficult\n                        to pick\n                        a single event. The journey from getting admitted for ceramics engineering stream to getting a job\n                        at Tata\n                        Refractories was difficult but satisfying. I was part of the first batch that got into ceramics\n                        engineering\n                        at REC Rourkela. When we joined REC, there was no building for the ceramic engineering department\n                        and there\n                        were no faculties. Many of our seniors and classmates would question our decision to join ceramics.\n                        It was\n                        quite depressing. However, Prof. B.N. Samaddar, the first head-of-the department kept motivating us.\n                        The\n                        initial faculties, Prof. Santanu Bhattacharyya, Dr. Sukumar Adak, and Prof. Swadesh Pratihar worked\n                        hard to\n                        build the department. The lack of facilities in REC meant that we learned from industrial visits and\n                        non-conventional sources. Looking back, it is very fulfilling to transition from being underdogs to\n                        whatever\n                        little we have achieved in our career. \"Adversity is a stepping stone for success\" is we experienced\n                        firsthand. The confidence from this journey remained with me and helped in to stretch myself beyond\n                        my\n                        comfort zone. This journey helped me in opting for a Ph.D. when I wanted to advance my career\n                        despite the\n                        fact that I was not inclined to pursuing Ph.D. during my engineering college days.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>You were concurrently pursuing an MBA as well as a Ph.D. at Drexel University. How did you manage\n                        the\n                        workload? Considering the fact that you were the first student at Drexel to complete an MBA and\n                        Ph.D.\n                        simultaneously, how would you describe the journey?\n                    </h4>\n                    <p>In my opinion, you cannot plan to pursue a Ph.D. and MBA together, and neither did I. It happened\n                        because of\n                        circumstances. Throughout my career, I was much more inclined towards business than technology. I\n                        came with\n                        a certain business experience from Tata Refractories that influenced me towards an MBA. I used to\n                        read a lot\n                        of business books and business magazines during my days at Tata Refractories. I also had training at\n                        the\n                        TMDC (Tata Management Development Center), which had a strong influence on me about business. At\n                        Drexel\n                        University, while I was doing my doctoral research, I managed to gather a team to develop a business\n                        plan\n                        for Drexel's Entrepreneurship Center's business plan competition. I developed a relationship with\n                        one of the\n                        LeBow School of Business's faculty, Dr. Sam Kurokawa, who later became my mentor. I used to have\n                        several\n                        conversations with him regarding the business plan, my interest in business and it got a point that\n                        I\n                        started taking more MBA classes. I approached my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Yury Gogotsi, and enquired\n                        whether he\n                        would be okay if I pursue an MBA while doing my Ph.D., and he readily accepted it. I have always\n                        been a\n                        hardworking person and by the time I got interested in MBA I had already completed 70-80% of my\n                        Ph.D. work.\n                        Another thing that helped me a lot was the fact that I got married in my 2nd year of Ph.D. I did not\n                        have to\n                        worry about cooking or doing the laundry or the basic odd jobs so I could focus completely on my\n                        studies. My\n                        wife was of great help!\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    {/* </p> */}\n                    <h4>How did the initial industry exposure at TRL and further research experience inspire you to\n                        establish\n                        Y-Carbon? </h4>\n                    <p>Definitely, there is a big role of Tata Refractories Limited (TRL) in shaping my career. TRL used to\n                        hire\n                        students from engineering colleges and they used to call them graduate trainees. Before we joined,\n                        the\n                        graduate trainees got a year or a year and half of training and then you would be placed into a job.\n                        In our\n                        case, that's not what happened. TRL's Managing Director, C.D Kamath was a very experienced and\n                        visionary\n                        leader, and he decided that we needed to go to work rather than getting such long training. The\n                        training was\n                        not typical learning in classes or human resource department rather it was field-based training. We\n                        learned\n                        by working. When you start working and are accountable for your job, you start learning quickly. In\n                        the\n                        process, I was placed in the Dolomite Department as a Senior Officer and I was the second-in-charge\n                        there. I\n                        performed very well at Dolomite and liked my job. When you are in such an accountable position at an\n                        early\n                        age, it would likely have a positive impact on your career. My experience at TRL wasn't the only\n                        factor in\n                        starting Y-Carbon, because I wasn't aspiring to start a company at that time but it did help me in\n                        my\n                        career.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>From being the general secretary of Ceramic engineering de-partment to Co-founder, CTO/CEO & Board\n                        Member of\n                        Y Carbon and now a Senior Specialist, Technology & Acquisition at Sabic you have occupied numerous\n                        positions\n                        of responsibilities. How do you manage the pressure and despondency at the same time ? </h4>\n                    <p>We generally spend more time working than any other activity. Work can be quite stressful if you\n                        don't enjoy\n                        it. Stress would naturally come to someone who is expecting a lot from his/her life. I was not very\n                        good at\n                        handling stress although I was better than others. For the last seven years, I've started spending\n                        around an\n                        hour daily on meditation and that has helped me immensely in maintaining work-life balance and\n                        calming down\n                        my restless mind. A lot of things in your career are not in your control and thus you have to engage\n                        in\n                        other activities to divert your mind when things don't go your way. I picked photography as a hobby,\n                        I spend\n                        time with my family and friends, I get involved in community-based organizations, and now I am\n                        slowly\n                        picking woodworking as a hobby. And as time passes, when you get more mature you can handle things\n                        much more\n                        easily than when you were young. One has to understand that life is not only about work, and in\n                        order to\n                        live a complete life, he/she has to engage in non-work activities.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>A message to the students and readers.</h4>\n                    <p>In general, there are a few things that have helped me immensely in my career. One of them is I do\n                        seek\n                        advice from experienced professionals and mentors. A lot of people don't have mentors, instead, they\n                        believe\n                        in learning from their own mistakes which is great but it takes time. You can considerably\n                        accelerate the\n                        learn-ing if you learn from other's mistakes. I would suggest students have mentors so that you can\n                        learn\n                        from other's mistakes. I have been quite disappointed that the NIT Rourkela community (stu-dent,\n                        faculty,\n                        and alumni) don't make efficient use of its vast alumni base to seek guidance. Alumni can be great\n                        mentors\n                        and they can come for free.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Blog1\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
