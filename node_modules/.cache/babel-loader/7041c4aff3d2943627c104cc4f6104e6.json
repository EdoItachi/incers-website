The departmental atmosphere was very\n                        progressive and productive, and the student-teacher interaction was the best in the institute.\n\n                    </p>\n                    <h4>How did you choose your field of interest or instead how did it find you? </h4>\n                    <p>There's this philosophy behind it.\n                        I was always interested in physical science and related stuff so according to my aptitude, I gave a name to\n                        my interest as 'Mechanical Engineering.' But in a broader sense, I was interested in knowing about the\n                        theories which would let me understand physically what is happening. So, it was just a matter of changing\n                        viewpoint, which eventually got me interested in ceramics and how one can manipulate certain things so that\n                        it will result in a desirable change in structure, microstructure and other properties.</p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>Why did you decide to switch from working in TRL to faculty in NITR and how did you decide that you wanted\n                        to study all the way up to Ph.D.? </h4>\n                    <p>I was an employee of TRL twice and NIT Rourkela twice. I was doing very well at TRL, and it was a very\n                        fast-paced learning process there. I installed refractories in various steel plants of SAIL and other\n                        private manufacturing units of petroleum. The professional career was up-and-coming there. It was Prof. R K\n                        Sinha, who encouraged me to pursue higher studies. He was the HOD at that time and also an advisor to TRL.\n                        Being his student, we had constant interactions in the company. During one such interaction, I was asked\n                        whether I am enjoying or not. To which I replied positively that it was exciting, but any well-trained\n                        person could do it, as it became easy after a while. After introspection, I realized that I would be better\n                        off doing intellectual stuff and would be at peace with myself. I got a Junior Lecturer post in NIT Rourkela\n                        and started teaching and doing projects with Prof. S. Bhattacharya and Prof. S. K. Pratihar. After a couple\n                        of years, I went on for Ph.D. in the USA and came back to join TRL again then joined NIT Rourkela in 2011.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>What are your views on core jobs in the Ceramic field? And what according to you is the reason that many\n                        students move to analytics and are not showing interest in their branch? </h4>\n                    <p>As a B Tech graduate, the decisions are mostly influenced by what the society perceives of you. Typically,\n                        one of them is how much money you earn is kind of a measure of how successful you are. In addition to that,\n                        core industries include physically stressful manufacturing jobs, and they are not generally attractive owing\n                        to various other factors. On the other hand, non-core jobs have a lovely setting, curated building, pleasant\n                        atmosphere, air-conditioned chambers, etc. It is easy for a 22-23-year-old person to be pulled by such\n                        prospects. Adding to it, the recent explosion in opportunities in those sectors like Al, analytics, Big\n                        Data, etc. All these factors combine to the diverting of students to the non-core industry. But then some\n                        students are intrinsically wired to it, and not only for the glamour of it.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>How has the Ceramic Engineering branch of NITR evolved over these years? </h4>\n                    <p>I've seen the times when we didn't even have an inch of our department. We used to have classes in the\n                        Administrative Building, and now we have a whole big building for ourselves. That's the physical aspect. We\n                        are one of the foremost departments to have started research on nanostructured materials. Our faculties have\n                        been very productive and are getting many sponsored projects, writing papers in highly reputed journals,\n                        speaking and presenting in reputed conferences, reviewing articles as critics, and much more. In all other\n                        aspects too, we are doing tremendously well if we look at the span of just 25 years, which is a short amount\n                        of time with regards to marking the growth of a department, which is core-engineering and technology-based.\n                        In spite of the increase in capital expenses, a requirement of equipment and machines, etc. the way we have\n                        progressed is quite commendable.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <h4>What are the prospects for the students?\n                    </h4>\n                    <p>B.Tech in Ceramics or some other courses like this have got a very balanced position, and if you do well\n                        here, you can jump into anything. These are interface departments, closely connected to physics, chemistry,\n                        and basic science and is equally connected to core engineering as well. So, we are almost everywhere, and\n                        there are tremendous opportunities for a B Tech Ceramic graduate. For higher university studies, you can get\n                        into any related discipline line electronics, mechanical, bio-ceramics, nanostructured materials, physics,\n                        chemistry, anywhere you like. Some students look for a career in management and being a part of the core\n                        technical program, and they are well suited for industries. As a B Tech guy, you will do better if you know\n                        your stuff and do the managerial job as long as you can top up your profile with a management degree. Also,\n                        a promising career is as an industry professional and getting into manufacturing industries. You can do\n                        whatever you like, once you find out what you want to do. Be clear about that and this program is a perfect\n                        platform for going anyway you want.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Blog\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
